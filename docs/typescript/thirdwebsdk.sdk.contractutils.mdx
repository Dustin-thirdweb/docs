Utilities to resolve contracts and ABI.

## Getting the ABI of a contract

You can obtain the ABI of any contract with the following code:

```ts
const sdk = new ThirdwebSDK(chain, {
  // pass your cliendId or secretKey...
});

const contract = await sdk.getContract("0x...");
const ABI = contract.abi;
```

## Getting all functions and events definitions from a contract

```ts
const sdk = new ThirdwebSDK(chain, {
  // pass your cliendId or secretKey...
});

const contract = await sdk.getContract("0x...");
const functions = await c.publishedMetadata.extractFunctions();
const events = await c.publishedMetadata.extractEvents();
```

## Getting the sources of a contract

To get the source code of a deployed contract:

```ts
const sdk = new ThirdwebSDK(chain, {
  // pass your cliendId or secretKey...
});

const contract = await sdk.getContract("0x...");
const sources = await contract.publishedMetadata.extractSources();
```

## Getting the implementation address of a Proxy

Resolve the implementation address and bytecode of a given proxy contract

```ts
const sdk = new ThirdwebSDK(chain, {
  // pass your cliendId or secretKey...
});

const { address, bytecode } = await resolveImplementation(
  "0x...", // the proxy address
  sdk.getProvider(),
);
console.log("Implementation address", address);
```
